# 💰 FinOps Strategy

## 📉 Cost Optimization

This section focuses on cost optimization strategies for cloud services.
FinOps is implemented to optimize cloud infrastructure spending through proactive monitoring, strategic resource allocation, and cost-saving mechanisms across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### 🔹 Key Cost Strategies

- 🏷 **Spot & Preemptible Instances** → Ideal for non-critical, short-term workloads.
- ⚡ **Auto-scaling** → Dynamically adjusts resources based on demand to prevent over-provisioning.
- 🔄 **Serverless Computing** → Pay only for execution time, reducing idle costs.
- 🎟 **Reserved Instances & Committed Use Discounts** → Long-term workload savings.
- 🚨 **Cost Control Alerts** → Prevent unexpected charges by setting budget thresholds.
- 🌍 **Multi-region Cost Efficiency** → Deploy workloads in cost-effective regions (e.g., São Paulo).
- 🔄 **Data Transfer Optimization** → Minimize inter-region transfer costs with efficient routing.
- 💾 **Efficient Storage** → Implement tiered storage solutions to optimize cost and performance.
