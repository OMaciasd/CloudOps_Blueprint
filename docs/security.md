# üîê Security Measures

This document outlines the security protocols, compliance standards, and best practices to ensure a secure cloud environment.

## üîë Key Areas

- **IAM & Access Control**:
  - Fine-grained IAM roles for least privilege access.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) and policy enforcement.
  - [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview), [GCP IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
- **Data Protection & Encryption**:
  - AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
  - TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
  - Key management using cloud-native KMS:
    - [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
    - [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/)
    - [GCP Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management)
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforced for all privileged users.
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure authentication.
  - [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Azure AD B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview), [Google Identity Platform](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform).
- **Security Monitoring & Auditing**:
  - Real-time security logging and SIEM integration.
  - Regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
  - [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), [Azure Security Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/), [GCP Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center).

## ‚úÖ Compliance & Standards

- **GDPR**: Ensures user data privacy and control ([EU GDPR Overview](https://gdpr.eu/)).
- **ISO 27001**: Security management best practices ([ISO 27001 Details](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)).
- **SOC 2**: Data security and confidentiality for cloud services ([SOC 2 Explained](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/article/soc-2-reports-faqs)).
- **NIST Framework**: Risk assessment and mitigation ([NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

By implementing these measures, we ensure a secure, compliant, and resilient cloud environment. üöÄ
